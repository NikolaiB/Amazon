This repo contains two tasks:

1. Wrote a program in Python (first_task.py) that counts backwards from 100 to 1.

2. Used Robot Framework to automate test case: Go to Amazon, navigate to some category and add two most expensive items to the shopping cart from this category.

To install Robot Framework run:

1) pip install selenium
2) pip install robotframework
3) pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
